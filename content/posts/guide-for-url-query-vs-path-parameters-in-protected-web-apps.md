Using standardised REST API practices to Web Application URLs

Recently, I had an engaging discussion about the best way to structure parameters within a website’s URL. It reminded me of my earlier work on eCommerce platforms between 2016 and 2018, where optimising URL structures was crucial. Since then, I’ve been focused on Fintech and credential-protected products, where URL structuring became less critical.

However, revisiting this topic by reading about other bloggers and their posts brought back memories of a few barely touched aspects that are invaluable in simplifying our codebase and enhancing the overall user experience.

In this article, I’ll share insights on using slugs, path parameters, and query parameters in web applications. These are key concepts in crafting clean, efficient URLs, and knowing when to use each one can significantly improve your frontend development and user experience.

#### Understanding the Basics: URL Paths, Slugs, and Query Parameters

URL path vs query parameter

To understand the value of these URL components, let’s first revisit how they’ve been used for decades to create well-structured REST API endpoints. Once the fundamentals are clear, it will become evident when and where to apply them in your web applications.

When building API endpoints, the **URL path** (or slug) is often used to define access to a specific resource. This path needs a URL-friendly identifier for the data you want to access, and it should be readable by both machines and humans. On the other hand, **query parameters** are ideal for actions like searching, sorting, filtering, and paginating results.

During my time at Zalando, I was part of the API chapter, where we had great guidelines for best practices in structuring these endpoints. These guidelines — still widely used in the industry — offer practical advice that can be applied to any web application, ensuring clarity and ease of use. They can be found [here](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#urls).

#### Why This Matters for Web Applications

Though much of this applies to APIs, the same principles are relevant for frontend development. **A well-structured URL path is more than just a technical necessity** — Google’s SEO algorithms use these paths to index and rank website content. **If done right, URLs can even give users a preview of the content before they click the link**. This is why search engines reward clean, well-organised URL structures.

But what about internal or credential-protected applications where SEO isn’t a concern? In these cases, maintaining a clear, intuitive URL structure reduces cognitive load for your users. **Users are accustomed to specific navigation patterns, and deviating from those can be frustrating** — especially for those relying on accessibility tools to navigate your site.

Moreover, adhering to standard URL practices makes life easier for your development team. If your APIs and frontend follow consistent URL patterns, **your team won’t need to switch mental gears when moving between projects**. This consistency reduces confusion and helps avoid unnecessary complexity.

#### Best Practices for URL Parameters

Adopting industry-standard practices is a smart move when building web applications, whether internal or external. Here are a few key takeaways:

1.  **Use URL paths or slugs for resources**: If you’re accessing a specific entity (like a product or user), include that entity in the URL path. Make the path short, readable, and descriptive.
2.  **Reserve query parameters for actions**: Use query parameters for actions like searching, filtering, or sorting — actions that modify or refine the content being requested.
3.  **Keep it simple**: Avoid overcomplicating your URL structures. Overly complex or custom URL formats can confuse users and developers alike, increasing both the cognitive load and the maintenance burden.
4.  **SEO considerations**: While I won’t go into SEO specifics here, it’s worth noting that a well-structured URL can improve your site’s visibility in search engines. For a more in-depth comparison of URL parameters and slugs, I recommend reading articles like “[URL Parameters vs. URL Slugs: What’s the Difference?](https://angulardive.com/blog/url-parameters-vs-url-slugs-what-s-the-difference/)” by Jose Matos.

#### Final Thoughts

In conclusion, when building any web application—whether public-facing or internal—stick to standardised industry practices for structuring your URLs. Doing so reduces the cognitive load for both your users and your team and simplifies the adoption of third-party tools that assume standard patterns.

While these practices aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution, they provide a solid foundation for making informed decisions. **Use your experience and judgment, and engage with the community to ensure your approach fits your project’s specific needs**. Following these principles will minimise development overhead, streamline user experience, and make your web applications more maintainable.
