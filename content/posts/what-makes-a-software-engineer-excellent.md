### What makes a software engineer excellent?

![What makes a software engineer excellent?](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*lqQy_JxaogqqEHXk7D7ADA.jpeg)

Recently, I face an interesting dilemma at work that made me question specific aspects of what makes a software engineer excel.

When you are working for your own company, or as an employee, an engineer needs to keep an eye in what it’s essential, meaningful productivity. Every time that you come to work, you should be asking yourself how can we do things better, not only for ourselves but for our business objectives.

It’s always great to think how cool a new feature, library or framework is and how much we can do with it. However, we need to aspire to solve the real problem. Is this new feature, it’s doing us more productive?

Recently, I have faced an interesting discussion at work concerning Axios vs Fetch as the main library to handle our AJAX calls. Looking this libraries objectively they are equivalent in fundamentals. Still, they may have a different interface to interact with them which we can use as an argument that can put one over the other based on the understanding of those interfaces.

To help you understand, Fetch API was introduced before joining to Beacon, and it was actively used until recently across our platform. Therefore, I was trying to understand what it was the problem we were trying to solve. I couldn’t refrain to stepping back and thinking about several high-level questions.

- What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- What that our the current library (Fetch) is not providing us the right functionality for us to be productive?
- Can we leverage our current implementation to make us more productive?
- What will it be the amount of effort in time that will take us to portate all the code produce in the last eight month?
- Is this the best use of our time as a team?

Looking for the root cause of the problem is an excellent exercise for us to challenge ourselves and help us to be more objectives on the decision-making process since our ultimate aim is delivering fast with confidence the features to achieve our business succeed.

#### Become the best version of yourself

Through my professional career, I tried to absorb the best qualities from the great software engineers; I have the pleasure to work with them.

**Disclosure**: This are qualities and skills that I believe it makes you excel as a software engineer from my point of view, and they may be different for you.

#### 1. Be proactive and not reactive

I failed on multiple occasion to provide constructive discussion that helps us to find better solutions together.

> Being proactive is a posture you take towards the world. It requires an individual to accept responsibility for his situation (no matter how dire) and take the initiative to make things better. Instead of letting their conditions and circumstances be the driving force of their decisions, proactive people allow their values to determine the choices they make. Proactive people act rather than being acted upon.—quote from [The 7 habits: Be proactive, not reactive](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/7-habits-proactive-not-reactive)

How am I working to adopt this habit during any discussion? **Preparing myself ahead of time whatever it is possible the topic in question and try to form an objective that I can use to position myself during the session**. Organising your thoughts in advance will give you a solid foundation when you share your point of view, helping to have constructive discussions since you won’t be reacting to other opinions but exchanging ideas and point of view.

#### 2. Think about the problem about all

The best decision made comes from understanding what it is the problem that you are trying to solve. As human being, we are great when it comes to problem-solving with well-defined boundaries.

[Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)) (TV Series) illustrate this quite well and show us how understanding the problem bring clarity and make the solution trivial once it’s understood.

#### 3. BUSINESS SUCCESS COME FIRST

As software engineers, we tend to be passion individuals which an inherent curiosity for discovering and trying new things. However, it’s easy to get drag into improving our skillset over what it will be best for the company you are working for.

A software engineer needs to balance this properly be laser focus on the company goals since the success of the business will be your success.

Finally, it’s essential to recognise that any business, in general, will go through cycles during your time on the company, and there is always going to be the opportunity for getting better into specific skills.

#### 4. OBSERVE AND LEARN NEW HABITS

Frequently, you will find people that proficient that is particularly good on a specific soft skill. Recently, I observed from a colleague during our conversations how he engages all the discussions with a genuine curiosity to understand what the person is sharing. This approach creates a safe environment to communicate my ideas; making our meetings more efficient and take better decisions to the point that I am always looking forward to the next opportunity to talk to them.

So be brave and embrace habit that you fell it will help you to become the best version of yourself.

#### 5. COMMUNICATION IS ALL

I learnt by hitting the wall many times that you cannot be the best engineer if you don’t communicate effectively. Your ideas are as good as the colleagues you can engage with them.

In most of the companies, you will face situations where you need to discuss and agree in decisions as collective. Consequently, the ugly truth the best pitch will win the race and not the best idea. This is a critical skill to have and need to be leverage early on your professional career if you want to lead and make things better.

#### Conclusion

Personally, my life experiences drove to stand by these principles, genuinely are areas that I saw in work colleagues and friend over the years. They live close to my heart today and help me to become better every day.

Nevertheless, I would like to hear your thoughts and help me to complete them with better or new ones. Looking forward to hear from you
