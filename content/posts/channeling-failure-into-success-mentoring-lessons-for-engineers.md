Yesterday, I had the pleasure of recording my first-ever podcast at [The Señor Developer](https://www.youtube.com/@NeciuDan) with [Dan Neciu](https://neciudan.dev/), where we talked about many exciting things—especially a topic very close to my heart: engineering mentoring. The video will be released soon, so make sure to subscribe to his channel so you don't miss it.

Despite my excitement to be there, I left with a familiar but awful internal feeling: **"I could have done better."** Have you ever felt this way? If so, then you can relate. I keep thinking... Eduardo, you have done meetups, conference speaking, and presenting for years, and on top of all that, mentored dozens of engineers both inside and outside of your job for years. How could you have missed saying this? Why didn't I say that instead? Why couldn't I have articulated that idea more clearly? Why did I miss the perfect opportunity to make a point?

However, it's obvious that there is no such thing as saying the "perfect" thing, since we always look back retrospectively. We cannot foresee what's coming our way, and we need to deal with the uncertainty and leftover remorse afterward.

## When Preparation Meets Reality: Challenges in Engineering Communication

After watching previous podcasts from other engineers and rehearsing my thoughts on technology, the truth is that I still struggled to communicate the way I wanted. The principles of [Chris Voss](https://www.blackswanltd.com/never-split-the-difference), effective communication, and other ideas I value seemed to slip through my fingers in the moment. My mind was full of ideas, principles, and concepts I wanted to share. I wondered why I didn't use mirroring here. Why didn't I apply tactical empathy? Why didn't I organise my thoughts more clearly around these key points?

So, what happened? What did I do wrong? Later that afternoon, my anxiety kicked in, and I ended up eating one too many ice creams :sweatsmile:, a habit I've had since my teenage years. Now, here I am in the gym the next morning, unable to stop thinking that something needs to change.

## Deciding How Challenges Shape You

When we go through these experiences, we must acknowledge our feelings and make them our own. We decide how they impact us, do they fuel our growth or erode the plank beneath us?

After more than 23 years of working on myself, this habit hasn't completely gone away. But I've learned to embrace these moments and use them as rocket fuel to reach new heights.

## Frustration Is Universal

The same thing happens when you're frustrated by a phone call to a company, a colleague, a manager, a job, or even a friend.

It's on us to take action. That frustration was the very driver for this article—an attempt to perfect what I couldn't express on the podcast, to show that we're all on this journey together. Even the richest and most successful people in the world face moments like this every single day.

## Turning These Frustrations Into Rocket Fuel

So, what will you do when this happens to you? How can you fuel your own rocket?

Engineering mentoring and career coaching can help you channel anger, frustration, or boredom, turning these feelings into the leverage you need to overcome obstacles and advance your professional growth.

Here are some steps to transform frustration into growth:

- **Acknowledge your feelings** honestly without judgment.
- **Reflect on the experience** to identify what you can learn.
- **Discuss challenges with a mentor** to gain perspective.
- **Set clear, achievable goals** based on insights.
- **Take consistent action** to turn lessons into progress.

From my experience, my mentoring approach is simple: we create a white canvas together, filling it with ideas and actions that transform corrosive triggers into powerful fuel that can take you wherever you want to go.

If you want a human mentor who faces these challenges too and chooses to make a difference, this is for you. I look forward to meeting you so we can create some magical alchemy together.

As my mantra from a Japanese martial art called Ninjustu or [Ninpo Tai jutsu](https://shinobikaiuk.co.uk/what-is-ninpo-tai-jutsu/) goes, nin (忍) has a very deep meaning:

> The kanji 忍 (Nin) is one of the most profound characters from the Japanese language, representing perseverance, patience and inner resilience. Beyond its literal meaning, this symbol encapsulates the idea of ​​enduring life's challenges with fortitude, facing them with calm and determination.

Quote extracted from [Kanji 忍 (Nin): Patience and Perseverance in Japanese Philosophy](https://en.kokusaibujinrenmei.org/Blogs/kanji-culture/kanji-nin-%E5%BF%8D-the-essence-of-patience-in-eastern-philosophy) written by Kazeirol.

## Final Thoughts

I leave you with a final thought: once anger and frustration are turned into rocket fuel, how far can you go until the deposit is empty? What can you do to have unlimited energy to continue? Is anger the only fuel?

Well, it's time to continue my morning workout, but I'll see you soon to make a change together.

> Remember Nin (忍) === Win.

If you got this far, it means you love the topic and want to learn more. Here is a really great talk from [Rachel Lee Nabors](https://nearestnabors.com/) about how to [Navigate Professional Relationships in the Tech Industry](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/en/videos/1276/how-to-navigate-professional-relationships-in-the-tech-industry-1734359933?_gl=1%2a1xtqugx%2a_up%2aMQ..%2a_ga%2aMTMxNjU5MDYzNi4xNzU0NzMwMTI4%2a_ga_CLQTX36RMG%2aczE3NTQ3MzAxMjckbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ3MzAxMjckajYwJGwwJGgyNTY3NTcwNzg.) that talks about how responsibility is a 50/50 split, which is well worth watching.
