He truly is a mentor in every sense of the word. We conducted the session in Spanish, which he speaks perfectly, and he also conducts sessions in English. We are studying specific areas for improvement and as we progress through these areas, we continue to improve the rest. It is uplifting to have a session with him.\n\nEstoy muy contento con la sesion, realmente hizo falta tiempo pero me asombra la capacidad que Eduardo tiene de analizar a la persona e identificar las fortalezas al mismo tiempo analiza las carencias y puntos a mejorar. Realmente es un mentor con todo el sentido de la palabra. Hicimos la sesion en espa√±ol el cual habla perfectamente tambien hace sesiones en ingles. Estamos estudiando areas puntuales para mejorar y al pasar de estas areas seguir mejorando las restante. Es edificante tener una sesion con el.",
